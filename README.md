# MERN-amazon

This is my MERN Amazon E-commerce website build. 

All server related processes are running on port 4000 and as usual React is running on 3000. 

This project taught me how to render data dynamically from a server to React. Previously I was using Embedded Javascript (EJS) templating to achieve this. Now I'm using
useEffect and React Router to handle data from the server.

So far, I have finished the main page with multiple items and added a carousel.
